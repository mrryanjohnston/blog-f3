# A little blog backend I wrote with Fat Free Framework

## Intro
I wanted to give fat free framework a go to see if I could create something 
useful. Out of that, and, personal vanity, came this.

## Seriously beta, dude
This is what I would term "hardcore beta." If you see any security holes, please
don't hesitate to send me a pull request or patch or something.

## Technologies used
* [Fat Free Framework](http://bcosca.github.com/fatfree/) - An awesome little
  PHP framework.
* [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) - Sweet plain text
  to HTML conversion tool.
* [PasswordLib](https://github.com/ircmaxell/PHP-PasswordLib) - Cool Library
  that handles the dirty work involved with password hashing and checking.
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) - A nifty framwork
  that allows for quickly building up UI elements of a webpage. I would say
  that I "barely" used this one, but I wanted to see how easy it was to handle.
* [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) - I'm using Disqus for the comments. Not sure if
  it belongs in this list, but here we go anyway!

## Legal stuff
As per my usual, I don't see why anyone would want to "steal" this (it's
posted for free on the interwebs), here's a license to look at, I guess:
